Welcome to my profile! I'm a learning software engineer from **Munich, Germany!** Currently I'm interested in
writing scripts for every possible matter, building bots for social media, developing software and building internal 
cheats. Aside from IT, I enjoy reading Mangas, watching Animes and playing Games: espacially <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Wambosu">osu!</a> and CS:GO.


Still wip
